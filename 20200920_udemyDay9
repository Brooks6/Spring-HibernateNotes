// Hibernate Overview
  1.what is hibernate: a framework for persisting/saving java objects in a database(www.hibernate.org)
  2.object-to-relational mapping(ORM): the developer defines mapping between java class and database table
  
// Hibernate and JDBC
  1.hibernate uses JDBC for all databse communications
  
// Hibernate Development Environment
  1.to build hibernate applications, you need the following: 1)java integrated development environment(IDE)
                                                             2)database server
                                                             3)hibernate jar files and jdbc driver

// Setting up Hibernate in Eclipse
  1.to do list: 1)create eclipse project
                2)download hibernate files
                3)download MySQL JDBC driver
                4)add JAR files to Eclipse project...build path
                
// Hibernate Development Process
  1.to do list: 1)add hibernate configuration file
                2)annotate java class
                3)develop java code to perform database operations
                
// hibernate Annotations
    1.two options for mapping: 1)xml config file(legacy)
                               2)java annotations(modern, preferred)
    2.java annotations: 1)map class to database table
                        2)map fields to dabase columns
                        
// Primary Keys - Changing the Starting Index
  1.ALTER TABLE hb_student_tracker.student AUTO_INCREMENT = 3000
  2.truncate hb_student_tracker.student(reset)
  
// Querying Objects with Hibernate
  1.hibernate query language(HQL): for retrieving objects and similar in nature to SQL(where, like, order by
                                   , join, in, etc)

// Advanced Mappings
  1.types: 1)one-to-one: an instructor can have an "instructor detail" entity, similar to an "instructor 
                         profile"
           2)one-to-many, many-to-one: an instructor can have many course
           3)many-to-many
           
// Database Concepts
  1.cascade: you can cascade operations, apply the same operation to related entities. If we delete an
             instructor, we should also delete their instructor_detail, this is known as "CASCADE DELETE"
  2.fetch types: 1)eager loading: will retrieve everything
                 2)lazy loading: will retrieve on request
